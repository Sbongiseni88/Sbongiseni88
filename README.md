# 💫 About Me

👋 Hi there!  

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
I am a Software Engineer and AI Developer dedicated to building high-impact, low-latency systems. While I have a strong foundation in Java-based backend solutions and RESTful APIs , my recent focus has shifted toward Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning integration.

I recently completed Game-Coded, a gamified educational platform for children aged 8–14. In this project, I spearheaded the AI implementation by architecting a hybrid chatbot system that utilizes TinyLlama for offline-first inference and falls back to Llama 3 for cloud-based queries.

Technical Highlights:
AI & Data: Specialized in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), ChromaDB vector embeddings, and real-time audio processing.
Backend Expertise: Proficient in Java (Spring Boot) and Python (AsyncIO, Flask) with a commitment to Test-Driven Development (TDD).
Professional Methodology: Experienced in brownfield development, which has sharpened my skills in navigating legacy codebases and working within Agile/Scrum frameworks.
Mentorship: I currently serve as a Peer & Technical Mentor at WeThinkCode_, where I guide junior developers through debugging and backend workflows.
I am passionate about leveraging AI to solve local challenges and am currently exploring new opportunities in the data-focused engineering space.

## 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Open-Source Security & Automation: Projects focused on secure data processing, TDD, and infrastructure automation
- Scalable Backend APIs: Developing robust server-side logic and RESTful endpoints in Java (Spring Boot) and Python (AsyncIO, Flask).  
- RAG & LLM Integration: Implementing high-accuracy Retrieval-Augmented Generation using ChromaDB and Large Language models 
- AI-Powered Educational Tools: Building accessible and profecient learning platforms 

## 💡 I’m looking for help with
- Secure Coding & Data Privacy: Implementing industry-standard security practices for handling user data and sensitive construction pricing information
- Real-World Backend Deployment: Strategies for scaling Python (AsyncIO) and Java (Spring Boot) applications in production environments like AWS
- Advanced Automation & DevOps: Optimizing CI/CD pipelines and automating testing workflows to maintain the 99% code reliability I strive for in my projects.
- System Design for Scalability: Refining the architecture of digital platforms to support high-concurrency real-time data processing.  

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Data-Driven Engineering & Analytics: Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms and applying data analysis principles to real-world datasets.
- System Design & Architecture: Studying principles for building scalable, reliable digital platforms  
- Linux system administration  
- Full-Stack JavaScript: Advancing through The Odin Project to complement my backend expertise in Python and Java
- Containerization & DevOps: Utilizing Docker for environment consistency and exploring CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment  
  
## 💼 Team Experience
Agile & Leadership: I have extensive experience working in and leading collaborative teams using Agile/Scrum methodologies, which has strengthened my ability to manage complex tasks and deliver high-quality software on schedule.

Technical Mentorship: As a Peer & Technical Mentor, I supervise and guide junior developers and other peer mentors, helping them navigate backend workflows, debugging, and Agile practices.

Hybrid AI Implementation: During the development of Game-Coded, I spearheaded the implementation of the chatbot's offline and online AI models, ensuring the application remained accessible in low-connectivity environments.

Infrastructure & DevOps: I have successfully implemented project automation and containerized deployments using Docker, focusing on creating reliable, reproducible environments for team-based projects.

Brownfield Development: My work on brownfield projects has significantly improved my soft skills and technical adaptability, as I’ve learned to navigate and enhance existing legacy codebases while maintaining team alignment
